# 🚗 Premium Scroll-Driven Hero Section

A premium scroll-based hero animation built using **React, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP ScrollTrigger**.

This project demonstrates advanced scroll-synchronized animation where the car movement, background reveal, and metrics display are all controlled by scroll progress.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React
- GSAP (ScrollTrigger)
- Tailwind CSS
- Modern CSS (gradients, shadows, blur effects)

---

## 🎯 How It Works

- The hero section is pinned using ScrollTrigger.
- Scroll distance is mapped to GSAP timeline progress.
- The car moves using `transform: translateX`.
- The green background width dynamically updates using the car's current position.
- Metrics are revealed at specific timeline positions.

This ensures smooth synchronization between all animated elements.
