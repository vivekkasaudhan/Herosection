## 🎯 How It Works

- The hero section is pinned using ScrollTrigger.
- Scroll distance is mapped to GSAP timeline progress.
- The car moves using `transform: translateX`.
- The green background width dynamically updates using the car's current position.
- Metrics are revealed at specific timeline positions.

This ensures smooth synchronization between all animated elements.
